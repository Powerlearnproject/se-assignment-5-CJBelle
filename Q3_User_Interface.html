  On the left hand side of your editor is a section called the activity bar.
  This bar holds the following tabs:

  * Explorer: this tab reveals or hides the menu that has the files and folder available to you. You can add a new file, open an existing folder and navigate between different files.
  <br>
  
  * Search: helps you search and open files, it also helps to search and replace

  <br>
  * Source control: tracks the changes / amendments you make in your files. It will also show you whether your changes are tracked by Github.
  <br>
  *Run / Run and debug: "Run" is used to validate the normal behavior of the software, while "debugging" is used to identify and fix abnormal
  behavior or errors.
  <br>
  "Run" is typically used during development for functional testing, while "debugging" is used to diagnose and fix issues that occur during the "run" process.
